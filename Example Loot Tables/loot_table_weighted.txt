Weighted
# Comment denoted by '#' at start of line
# First line must be Weighted or Uniform
# Item name and weight are separated by "!!"
# Greatsword and long bow each have same chance of being picked
# The chance of picking a dagger, chain mail, or scimitar (combined probablity) is equal to picking a greatsword or long bow
# If you design weights such that they total to 100, each weight can be thought of as a percentage
# You can have weights much higher than 100. E.g., greatsword!!990 and long bow!!10 gives long bow a 0.1% chance
